Omg, just finished watching Phule and I'm like... I dunno, mixed feels? It's one of those movies where you're, like, on the edge of loving or rolling your eyes the whole time. You know what I mean? So, okay, I got the movie downloaded yesterdayâ€”guess it helped 'cause the quality was ðŸ¤Œ. 

But seriously, why do they always have to drag out the drama sooooooo much? ðŸ˜… Like, just let some stuff slide, people! The lead's acting, though... wow. They really pulled it off, that sincerity was something else. Although, at one point I couldnâ€™t decide if I wanted to watch the movie further or take a nap, hahaha.

>The whole plot twist thing, did you see it coming? I was like, No way!! And then, five minutes later, Ehhh, maybe way, ðŸ˜‚. Also, the. most. dramatic. movie. dialogue. but hey, I was sipping my tea and living for it, ngl. 

And oh my god, the soundtrack!! Am I the only one who's still humming it? It's just stuck there forever now. But I have to admit, halfway through I kinda zoned out... like couldn't tell if I was following the plot or my own daydreams, heh. Relatable, right?

Some random dude gets tossed into the mix and Iâ€™m just there thinking, Do we really need more characters? Like, I lost track already! ðŸ˜† Too much multitasking.

int whyDidIWriteThis = 0; // honestly no clue why this popped into my head!!

Anyway, if you're in the mood for some wild emotional ping pong, Phuleâ€™s your pick, girl! Watch it when you're good and ready for a rollercoaster. But if you catch some of the stuff that totally went over my head, letâ€™s chat about it! Need allll the deets I missed while I was busy getting lost in my thoughts. ðŸ¥´
